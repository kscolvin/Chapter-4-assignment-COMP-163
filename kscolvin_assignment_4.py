Description: This is a simple adventure game where the player navigates through college life. The player will make choices that affect the outcome of the game, including their GPA, stress levels, and social points. The game has multiple endings based on the player's decisions throughout the semester.
AI Usage: I used AI to help debug and improve the code after testing it, as well as improving my answer replies. (I added my own charm still!)
